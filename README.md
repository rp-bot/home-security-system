# Arduino Home Security System
An Arduino-based home security system that makes use of the Esp32 WIFI chip and the 802.11 WIFI communication protocol to establish a connection between the device and the 
server(home security system). This setup allows a constant stream of information from the sensors and the actuators present in the circuit.

## Team
This project was a 2 person semester project for the Internet of Things class. The work for this project consisted of:
- Research/ Literature Review
- Sourcing parts for the circuit (wires and sensors)
- Understanding how the sensors worked
- Designing the Circuit
- Writing Code
All of these tasks were equally divided between [Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratham-vadhulas/) and [Zachary Hayes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyhayes02/)
